# Bayesian hypothesis testing {.section}

## Bayesion Hypothesis

* $H_0$, the null hypothesis. This is an invariance or “general law”. For instance $\theta = 1$ (all swans are white) or $\theta = .5$ (people cannot look into the future – performance is at chance).
* $H_A$ is the hypothesis that relaxes the restriction imposed by $H_0$.

## Prior Belief

$$\huge \underbrace{\frac{P(H_A \mid data)}{P(H_0 \mid data)}}_\textrm{Posterior belief} = \underbrace{\frac{P(H_A)}{P(H_0)}}_\textrm{Prior belief} \times \underbrace{\frac{P(data \mid H_A)}{P(data \mid H_0)}}_\textrm{Bayes Factor}$$

## Bayes Factor

$$\underbrace{\frac{P(data \mid H_A)}{P(data \mid H_0)}}_\textrm{Bayes Factor}$$
A ratio of the likelihood of the date under the alternative and the null.

A Bayes factor of ${BF}_{10} = 3$, means that the data are 3 times more likely onder the alternative than under the null.
