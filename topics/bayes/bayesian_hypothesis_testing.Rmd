# Bayesian hypothesis testing {.section}

## Bayesion Hypothesis

* $H_0$, the null hypothesis. This is an invariance or “general law”. For instance $\theta = 1$ (all swans are white) or $\theta = .5$ (people cannot look into the future – performance is at chance).
* $H_A$ is the hypothesis that relaxes the restriction imposed by $H_0$.

## Prior Belief

$$\huge \underbrace{\frac{P(H_A \mid data)}{P(H_0 \mid data)}}_\textrm{Posterior belief} = \underbrace{\frac{P(H_A)}{P(H_0)}}_\textrm{Prior belief} \times \underbrace{\frac{P(data \mid H_A)}{P(data \mid H_0)}}_\textrm{Bayes Factor}$$

## Bayes Factor {.subsection}

$$\underbrace{\frac{P(data \mid H_A)}{P(data \mid H_0)}}_\textrm{Bayes Factor}$$
A ratio of the likelihood of the date under the alternative and the null.

A Bayes factor of ${BF}_{10} = 3$, means that the data are 3 times more likely onder the alternative than under the null.

## Simple BF explanation

The special case of the Bayes Factor for null hypotheses testing can be visualised as the difference between the likelihood of the data at $H_A$ / $H_1$ and $H_0$ at the parameter value that represents the null.

BF       | Evidence
---------|----------
 1 – 3   | Anecdotal
 3 – 10  | Moderate
10 – 30  | Strong
30 – 100 | Very strong
>100     | Extreme
